# Why I create this repo?
I have been a Java developer for almost 6 years, I learn a lot frameworks in my work time, but most of them just in use level. In the past few years, I tried three time to keep write tech blog every weeks , but quick fail after few months.

I have to say it's not easy to be a good software enginer. especial for a backend(my opinion). Because there are so many things in this huge ecosystem that you have to know.
such as:
- networks theory(ICMP,TCP,IP,HTTP,H2,H3,TLS,SSL)
- cache theory and application(cpu cache,memery cache,redis,memecache,guava,etcd)
- mq(rabbit,rocket,kafka)
- data structure adn alg
- virtual container(docker,k8s)
- microservice(spring ecosystem)
- distrubute ecosys(zk,distrubute scheduler) and so on

And one day, I realized why I can't keep going is that I don't have a good habit to manage my knowledage, my knowledge just like isolated islands. So after long struggling, I decide to create a repo to record my study trip. 


> Tips: ðŸ˜ŠThis repo is not just about tech, but also include book sharing, philosophy or something else. Oh, I can also improving my English writing.
